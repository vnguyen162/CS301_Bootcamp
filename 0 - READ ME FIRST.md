# About

The material for this  bootcamp is designed as a refresher course for 
student about to start Data Structures and Algorithms at CSUEB.  While the 
bootcamp does not cover all topics from the previous courses, it covers 
some of the most critical topics required to be successful in a Data
Structures and Algorithms course.

# Setting Up the IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

Guides for setting up the IDE and programming environment are available 
[here](Setting%20up%20the%20IDE%20(IMPORTANT).md). The material of this 
bootcamp can be run out of the box (mostly) on JetBrain's IDE CLion and will 
be the supported platform for this bootcamp. CLion is freely available for 
students and runs on Window, MacOS, and Linux.

The material can also be run on Visual Studio Code with some additional 
setup of the programming environment. Visual Studio Code is also 
cross-platform and can run on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.  While you are 
welcome to use this platform, we will not be supporting this platform during 
the bootcamp. Also note that Visual Studio Code is *not* the same as Visual 
Studio. While it may be possible to use Visual Studio for the bootcamp material,
we currently do not have any documentation to set up the environment on the 
Visual Studio IDE.

> **TLDR**
> 
> You can use whatever IDE you want, but you really should use CLion since it 
> is a solid IDE and it is the IDE we will officially support during the 
> bootcamp.


# GitHub

All the material for the workshop is hosted on GitHub. In order to use the 
material, you will need to create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/).

We assume that most students in the bootcamp have never used git version 
control before.  During the bootcamp we will demonstrate the basic git 
commands you will need.
